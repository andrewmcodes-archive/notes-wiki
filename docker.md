# Docker

## Development Tools

### Captain

Captain searches for docker-compose projects in your `$HOME` folder and allows you to start and stop those projects by matching the project's directory name.

```
curl -L https://github.com/jenssegers/captain/releases/download/0.3.3/captain-osx > /usr/local/bin/captain && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/captain
```

#### List

To see a list of running docker-compose projects, run:

```sh
docker ls
