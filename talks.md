[RailsConf 2019 - Database Design for Beginners by David Copeland - YouTube](https://youtu.be/1VsSXRPEBo0)

DB design is how we ensure our database is the source of truth

**Step 1:** what facts do we want to **record**

The act of DB design is really about understanding the requirements very clearly so the first step is to write them down.

**Anomalies** when the data model prevents the storage of certain facts, allows ambiguity to exist, or requires deleting one fact to delete another. **Normalization** is the process by which we remove anomalies from our design.
